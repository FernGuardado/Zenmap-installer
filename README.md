A script that installs zenmap

NOTE: I DO NOT OWN ZENMAP/NMAP, ALL CREDIT GOES TO GORDON "FYODOR" LYON, MAKE SURE YOU CHECK OUT https://nmap.org/ FOR MORE INFO.

A script that installs nmaps GUI version, Zenmap.

I made this script because the newer versions of kali linux doesn't have zenmap.

Might update this if a newer version comes out.
